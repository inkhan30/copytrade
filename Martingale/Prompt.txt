Strategy Overview
Initial Entry Condition:

The EA opens the first trade when ConsecutiveCandles (e.g., 2) consecutive bullish (up) or bearish (down) candles are detected.

The initial trade uses a user-defined InitialLotSize and a take-profit (InitialTPPoints).

Hedging Mechanism:

If the price moves against the initial trade by TriggerPoints (e.g., 500 points), the EA opens additional positions ("hedges") in the same direction as the initial trade.

The lot sizes for hedges follow a user-defined sequence (CustomLotSequence), parsed into an array.

Profit Target:

All positions are closed when the combined unrealized profit reaches ProfitTargetPoints (e.g., 100 points).

Risk Management:

The EA stops opening new trades after MaxTrades (e.g., 25) positions are reached.

No stop-loss is implemented; reliance is on the profit target.
