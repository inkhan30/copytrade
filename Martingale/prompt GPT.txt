Overview
This Expert Advisor implements a simple 2‐candle breakout entry followed by a Martingale‑style hedging sequence.

Initial entry is taken when two consecutive candles close in the same direction (bullish or bearish).

Hedge entries are added in the same direction whenever price moves against the original entry by a user‑defined number of points.

All positions are closed once the combined profit (across all open trades) reaches a user‑defined point target.

Lot sizes for each hedge step are specified in a comma‑separated sequence, and all distance parameters (TP, trigger, profit) are in points.
