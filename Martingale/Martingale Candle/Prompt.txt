Strategy Overview
Initial Entry Condition:

The EA opens the first trade when ConsecutiveCandles (e.g., 2) consecutive bullish (up) or bearish (down) candles are detected.

The initial trade uses a user-defined InitialLotSize and a take-profit (InitialTPPoints).

Hedging Mechanism:

if the candle closes below the price of the current trade open a new trade at the next candle close from the user define lot sequence.

Profit Target:

All positions are closed when the combined unrealized profit reaches ProfitTargetPoints (e.g., 100 points).

Risk Management:

The EA stops opening new trades after MaxTrades (e.g., 25) positions are reached.

No stop-loss is implemented; reliance is on the profit target.


Key Input Parameters
Parameter	Description
ConsecutiveCandles	Number of consecutive candles to trigger the initial trade.
InitialLotSize	Lot size for the first trade.
InitialTPPoints	Take-profit distance (in points) for the initial trade.
CustomLotSequence	Comma-separated lot sizes for subsequent hedges.
ProfitTargetPoints	Combined profit (points) to close all trades.
MaxTrades	Maximum number of trades (initial + hedges).
MagicNumber	Unique identifier for EA-managed trades.


Example Scenario:
Initial BUY at 1.2000 (0.1 lots)

Price drops → new BUY at 1.1950 (0.2 lots)

Price drops again → new BUY at 1.1900 (0.4 lots)

Market reverses → all positions close when total profit hits 100 points.



Full Strategy Workflow:

Initial Entry:

Triggers after ConsecutiveCandles bullish/bearish candles.

Example: 2 consecutive green candles → initial BUY with InitialLotSize.

The initial trade uses a user-defined InitialLotSize and a take-profit (InitialTPPoints).

Hedging:

Adds trades in the same direction when the market moves against the latest position.

Example: If initial BUY is at 1.2000 and price closes at 1.1950 in the next candle → new BUY with next lot from CustomLotSequence.

Profit Closure:

Closes all trades when combined profit reaches ProfitTargetPoints.

Example: 100 points net profit → exit all positions.

Risk Control:

Stops opening new trades after MaxTrades 25 (e.g., 25 positions)
