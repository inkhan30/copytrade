Strategy Overview
Initial Entry Condition:

The EA opens the first trade when ConsecutiveCandles (e.g., 2) consecutive bullish (up) or bearish (down) candles are detected.

The initial trade uses a user-defined InitialLotSize and a take-profit (InitialTPPoints).

Hedging Mechanism:

if the candle closes below the price of the current trade open a new trade at the next candle close from the user define lot sequence.

Profit Target:

All positions are closed when the combined unrealized profit reaches ProfitTargetPoints (e.g., 100 points).

Risk Management:

The EA stops opening new trades after MaxTrades (e.g., 25) positions are reached.

No stop-loss is implemented; reliance is on the profit target.


Key Input Parameters
Parameter	Description
ConsecutiveCandles	Number of consecutive candles to trigger the initial trade.
InitialLotSize	Lot size for the first trade.
InitialTPPoints	Take-profit distance (in points) for the initial trade.
CustomLotSequence	Comma-separated lot sizes for subsequent hedges.
ProfitTargetPoints	Combined profit (points) to close all trades.
MaxTrades	Maximum number of trades (initial + hedges).
MagicNumber	Unique identifier for EA-managed trades.


Example Scenario:
Initial BUY at 1.2000 (0.1 lots)

Price drops → new BUY at 1.1950 (0.2 lots)

Price drops again → new BUY at 1.1900 (0.4 lots)

Market reverses → all positions close when total profit hits 100 points.



Full Strategy Workflow:

Initial Entry:

Triggers after ConsecutiveCandles bullish/bearish candles.

Example: 2 consecutive green candles → initial BUY with InitialLotSize.

The initial trade uses a user-defined InitialLotSize and a take-profit (InitialTPPoints).

Hedging:

Adds trades in the same direction when the market moves against the latest position.

Example: If initial BUY is at 1.2000 and price closes at 1.1950 in the next candle → new BUY with next lot from CustomLotSequence.

Profit Closure:

Closes all trades when combined profit reaches ProfitTargetPoints.

Example: 100 points net profit → exit all positions.

Risk Control:

Stops opening new trades after MaxTrades 25 (e.g., 25 positions)

I want to change ONLY hedging logic

Suppose the initial 1st trade is at 3000 (xauusd)

so i want the next hedge position to be at the close of m1 time frame candle if its below 3000.

Example scenario

1st trade at 3000 ( xauusd )
next m1 candle closes at 2998 hedging 1st position should open from user define custom lots.
now next m1 candle will close at 3001 no hedge position
now next m1 candle will close at 2990 2nd position should open from user define custom lots.
like this keep going till max trades.

ONLY CHANGE HEDGE LOGIN REMAINING ALL KEEP SAME.


Revise the existing trading algorithm to implement a new hedging logic while keeping all other parameters and functionalities unchanged.The initial trade is executed at a price of 3000 (XAUUSD).The new hedging rules are as follows: 1.Monitor the closing price of each 1-minute (M1) timeframe candle.2.If the closing price of an M1 candle is below 3000, initiate a hedge position using a user-defined custom lot size.3.If the closing price of an M1 candle is above or equal to 3000, do not initiate any hedge position.4.Continue to check each subsequent M1 candle for hedge positions until reaching a predefined maximum number of trades (max trades).5.Ensure that the lot size for each new hedge position corresponds to the user-defined custom lot size.Example scenario for clarity: - Initial trade executed at 3000 (XAUUSD).- M1 candle closes at 2998: Open a hedge position with user-defined custom lots.- M1 candle closes at 3001: No hedge position initiated.- M1 candle closes at 2990: Open a 2nd hedge position with user-defined custom lots.- Continue this process until the maximum trade limit is reached.Make sure to maintain all other trading rules and parameters intact, focusing solely on the modification of the hedging logic as specified."
