You are tasked with modifying an existing trading strategy code to implement a new feature related to counter trade stop loss (SL) and opening trades.

Specifically:
- When the counter trade reaches the stop loss (SL), immediately open a new trade.
- The new trade's parameters (stop loss in pips, trade value, maximum allowed trades, and trade direction) should be defined by the user.
- The strategy should open trades only up to the maximum number of trades specified by the user.
- All other existing functionality and code should remain unchanged.

Please incorporate this feature clearly into the current strategy code, ensuring proper handling of user input parameters for:
- Stop loss in pips
- Trade value
- Maximum number of trades
- Direction of the trade

Include adequate comments to explain the new implementation and preserve the original code structure and logic apart from the added feature.

# Steps
1. Detect when counter trade hits stop loss.
2. Check if the current number of trades is less than the user-defined maximum trades.
3. Open a new trade using the user-defined stop loss pips, trade value, and direction.
4. Keep the rest of the code and existing logic intact.

# Output Format
Provide the modified code snippet implementing the described feature with inline comments explaining the changes.









Revise the instruction "Diroction for counter re-entries" so that its guidance matches exactly the same as the guidance provided for "counter trade." Carefully compare the existing instructions for both terms and update the text for counter re-entries to be consistent with and identical in approach to the instructions for counter trade.

# Steps

1. Identify the current instructions for "counter trade."  
2. Identify the current instructions for "counter re-entries."  
3. Analyze the differences between both instructions.  
4. Rewrite or modify the instruction for "counter re-entries" so it matches exactly that of "counter trade."  

# Output Format

Provide the revised instruction text for "counter re-entries." If possible, include the original "counter trade" instruction for reference.

# Notes

- Ensure spelling and wording reflect the intended meaning precisely.
- Maintain clarity and consistency between both instructions.
- If no existing text is available, state that explicitly and request further input.
